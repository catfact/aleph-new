for python 2

you need:

pyOSC: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOSC
pySerial: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial

change line 6 of aleph-com.py to match your serial device (ie /dev/ttyACM0 on linux)

also on linux you need to be root

a.sh provided for less typing

listens for OSC on port 12001

default sends to port 12010

failed to test OSC on linux, get this to try: http://fukuchi.org/works/oscsend/index.html.en
